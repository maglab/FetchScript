Welcome to FetchScript's documentation!
=======================================

The fetchscript is a python module that is designed to simplify the process of fetching biological information from various external databases uses their API's. Although in some cases this isn't too difficult to do this module should simplify the need to get basic infromation out of these databases without having to wade through levels of XML (I'm looking at you NCBI Entrez Gene database).
